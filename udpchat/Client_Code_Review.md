On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not accomplish everything stated in the README.md file
4  The program compiles and accomplishes everything stated in the README.md file but is insufficiently documented
5  The program accomplishes everything stated in the README.md and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:
Your client was well written with comments that made it easy to follow.  The only thing
I would suggest would be explaining why you left a couple lines of code commented out,
instead of just deleting them.  That might make your code a little easier to read.
