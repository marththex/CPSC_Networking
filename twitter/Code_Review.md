On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 2 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines (e.g. it contains extraneous code from the example program that has not been removed) or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:

I don't think the code was ever committed or I don't have access to it. All I see is the commit of adding the sentiment.py file. I can review again once it is committed.
